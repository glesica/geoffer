## Geoffer

A Python library and command line application for converting data to Geoff
format for easy bulk insertion into a Neo4j database.

Load2neo: <http://nigelsmall.com/load2neo>

Eventually this library will be able to handle everything from converting data
into Geoff to actually uploading the results into Neo4j through the Load2neo API
endpoint. Simple file formats will also be supported directly from the command
line, no code necessary.
